## About The Game

*Arcane Bastion* is a strategic tower defense game that challenges you to become the ultimate magical defender. Hordes of monsters are marching to destroy the sacred crystal, and only your command of elemental magic can stop them.

Place and upgrade a variety of powerful towers—Fire and Ice—along the enemy's path. Defeat waves of enemies to earn gold, and use it to build an impenetrable fortress of magical power.

-   **Wave-Based Survival:** Defeat increasingly difficult waves of enemies.
-   **Resource Management:** Manage your gold to build and upgrade towers at the right time.
